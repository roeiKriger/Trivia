# Trivia App Game in Android Studio Using Flask.
A side project in order to practice API, Flask library and Android application development. <br />
The Backend side is written in Python and I used Flask Library in order to create a JSON which was exported to the API I created. <br />
The Frontend side which is written in Java and in Android Studio is extracting the JSON (of questions and answers for the Trivia), using okhttp3 library for the get request.

The Frontend code logic is in the next path: Trivia_Frontend\app\src\main\java\com\example\triviaflask. <br />
The Backend code logic is in main.py file.
